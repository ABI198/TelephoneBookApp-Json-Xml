# TelephoneBook Application With .json and .xml Files as Database
In this project, a desktop application was developed using N-Tier Architecture and Result Pattern.

In addition, instead of using dto pattern, a much more ancient method was preferred 
and the experience of why dto is so important was gained.<br />
